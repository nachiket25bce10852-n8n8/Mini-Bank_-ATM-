# Project Title  
Mini ATM System using Python

## Problem Statement  
Many beginners in programming find it difficult to understand how banking systems work internally.  
This project aims to provide a simple and easy-to-understand ATM system that demonstrates the  
basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine such as:

- Creating a new account  
- Logging in using account number and PIN  
- Checking balance  
- Depositing money  
- Withdrawing money  

The system helps users understand how different modules of a banking system work together in a  
realistic flow, while keeping the logic simple enough for academic learning.

## Purpose of the Project  
The purpose of this mini-project is to apply Python programming concepts—functions, classes,  
conditional statements, loops, and file/module separation—into a working real-world simulation.

## Scope  
This project is designed for academic demonstration and is suitable for mini-projects or  
coursework submissions. It does not use a real database or security system; instead, it uses  
simple Python logic to keep the system easy to understand.

## Outcome  
By the end of this project, a user can:

- Understand the workflow of ATM systems  
- Learn how different Python modules work together  
- Experience basic banking operations  
- Gain confidence in writing modular, organized Python code
